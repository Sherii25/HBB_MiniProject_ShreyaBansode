# HBB_MiniProject_ShreyaLastName

## 📌 Project Title
**Evolutionary Analysis of the HBB Gene Across Multiple Species**

## 🧬 Objective
To explore the evolutionary conservation of the HBB (Hemoglobin subunit beta) gene across six species using pairwise alignment, multiple sequence alignment, sequence logo analysis, and phylogenetic tree construction.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **NCBI Protein Database** – Sequence retrieval
- **EMBOSS Needle** – Pairwise alignment
- **Clustal Omega** – Multiple Sequence Alignment  
- **Skylign** – Sequence logo generation    
- **MEGA X** – Phylogenetic tree construction  
- **MS Word / Google Docs** – Report preparation  

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Retrieved HBB protein sequences from NCBI for six species.
2. Conducted pairwise alignment using EMBOSS Needle.
3. Performed multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega.
4. Generated a sequence logo to visualize conserved residues.
6. Constructed a phylogenetic tree using MEGA X.
7. Documented findings in a comprehensive report.

## 📄 Report
The complete report is available in the repository as:
